1) The PCB class is defined in calos.py directly under the CalOs class definition.
2) It's name, pid, next pid, entry point, lowest memory point, highest memory point, and it's state
3) In main.py, in the _load_program() function, line 180.
4) New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Done
5) current_proc is defined at the very start of the CalOS class - it refers to the PCB of the current process. 
You need to use it to access PCB methods and variables.
6) In Python, 'with' is used to handle resource allocation and make sure everything is cleaned up properly. By
using with, we can assure countdown isn't incorrectly written and won't run into errors.
7) When the countdown hits 0 it passes an interrupt, then sets the countdown to not running.
